Therefore, there is only one small rubber car (the red car) that is left of the shiny object.\n</think>\n<answer>\n1\n</answer>",

The only object described as a yellow minivan is \"yellow bus,\" which is not present in the scene. Therefore, there are no yellow minivans in the scene.\n\nNext, we need to determine if there are any purple buses. The scene contains a purple bus, which is described as a small purple bus with a purple roof. This matches the description given in the scene.\n\nSince there is one purple bus and no yellow minivans, the total number of matte objects that are either yellow minivans or purple buses is 1.\n</think>\n<answer>\n1\n</answer>",

Since we don't have information about the material of the big mountain bike, we cannot determine if it's made of the same material as the small purple thing.\n</think>\n<answer>\n0\n</answer>",

Since there are no other blue matte objects in the scene, and the airplane is not to the right of the green biplane, there are no blue matte objects to the right of the green biplane.\n\nTherefore, the number of blue matte objects to the right of the green biplane is 0.\n</think>\n<answer>\n0\n</answer>",
