Therefore, the weight of 4 apples is equal to the weight of 9 plums.\n\nTo find out how many plums weigh as much as one apple, we divide the number of plums by the number of apples:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of plums per apple} = \\frac{\\text{Number of plums}}{\\text{Number of apples}} = \\frac{9}{4}\n\\]\n\nThis calculation gives us the ratio of plums to apples. However, since we are looking for a whole number of plums that weigh exactly as much as one apple, we need to consider the simplest form of this ratio. \n\nGiven that 9 plums do not balance exactly with 4 apples, we need to find a common multiple that does. The simplest way to do this is to multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n\\[\n9 \\times 4 = 36 \\text{ plums}\n\\]\n\nNow, we have 36 plums on the right side, which is equivalent to 4 apples on the left side. This means that 9 plums weigh as much as 4 apples, but we need to find how many plums weigh as much as one apple.\n\nSince 9 plums weigh as much as 4 apples, we can set up the following proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9 \\text{ plums}}{4 \\text{ apples}} = \\frac{x \\text{ plums}}{1 \\text{ apple}}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{9}{4} \\text{ plums per apple}\n\\]\n\nHowever, since we need a whole number of plums, we should consider the simplest form of this ratio. The simplest form is when we take the least common multiple of 9 and 4, which is 36. So, 36 plums weigh as much as 4 apples, and therefore, 9 plums weigh as much as 1 apple.\n\nThus, the number of plums that weigh as much as an apple is 9.\n\n</think>\n<answer>3</answer>",

The face opposite to the kangaroo face will be the one that is not adjacent to any of these faces.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n- (A) Blue circle: This could be the opposite face if the blue circle is adjacent to the star, triangle, circle, and arrow.\n- (B) Green triangle: This could be the opposite face if the green triangle is adjacent to the star, triangle, circle, and arrow.\n- (C) Yellow star: This could be the opposite face if the yellow star is adjacent to the star, triangle, circle, and arrow.\n- (D) Arrow: This could be the opposite face if the arrow is adjacent to the star, triangle, circle, and arrow.\n- (E) Red square: This could be the opposite face if the red square is adjacent to the star, triangle, circle, and arrow.\n\nSince the problem does not provide specific information about the adjacency of the faces, we can assume that any of these faces could be opposite to the kangaroo face. However, without additional context or constraints, we cannot definitively determine which one is correct.\n\nGiven the options provided, let's choose one based on common assumptions in such problems. Typically, the most straightforward and commonly used option is the one that is not immediately adjacent to the given figure.\n\nTherefore, I will select option (A) as the most likely candidate for the opposite face.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nC\n</answer>",

Since Lea is one year younger than Ali, and Lea is two years older than Josef, we can place the ages as follows: Vittorio < Josef < Lea < Ali < Sophie.\n\nGiven this information, we can match each child with their corresponding cake:\n- Vittorio is the youngest, so his cake should have the smallest number.\n- Lea is one year older than Vittorio, so her cake should have the next smallest number.\n- Josef is one year older than Lea, so his cake should have the next smallest number.\n- Ali is two years older than Lea, so his cake should have the next smallest number.\n- Sophie is two years older than Ali, so her cake should have the largest number.\n\nSince the cakes are labeled from A to E, and we know the order of the ages, we can assign the cakes as follows:\n- Vittorio's cake (smallest number): E\n- Lea's cake: D\n- Josef's cake: C\n- Ali's cake: B\n- Sophie's cake: A\n\nTherefore, Sophie's cake belongs to the number 8.\n</think>\n<answer>D</answer>",

The square has a side length of 1, so its diagonal will be \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) because the diagonal of a square with side length \\(a\\) is given by \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nThe diagonal of the square is also the diameter of the larger circle that circumscribes the square. Therefore, the radius of the larger circle is half of the diagonal, which is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n\nNow, consider the smaller circle that is tangent to the square at one of its corners. The center of this smaller circle will lie on the line segment connecting the midpoints of two adjacent sides of the square. This line segment is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs each equal to half the side length of the square, i.e., \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).

Since the radius of the larger circle is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\), the radius of the smaller circle is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} - 1}{2}\\).\n\nHowever, we need to express this in terms of the options provided.

Since the circles are touching each other externally, the distance between their centers is \\(2r = 2 \\times 1 = 2\\).\n\n2. **Draw the line segment connecting the centers**: The line segment \\(O_1O_2\\) is parallel to the side of the square and is equal to the side length of the square plus twice the radius of the circles because the square's side is tangent to both circles at points that are 1 unit away from the centers of the circles.\n\n3. **Use the Pythagorean theorem**: The side length of the square, let's call it \\(s\\), forms a right triangle with half the side length of the square (which is \\(s/2\\)) and the distance between the centers of the circles (which is 2). The hypotenuse of this right triangle is the side length of the square minus twice the radius of the circles, i.e., \\(s - 2\\).\n\nSo, we have:\n\\[ (s - 2)^2 + (s/2)^2 = s^2 \\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\\[ s^2 - 4s + 4 + s^2/4 = s^2 \\]\n\\[ s^2 - 4s + 4 + \\frac{s^2}{4} = s^2 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{5s^2}{4} - 4s + 4 = s^2 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{5s^2}{4} - s^2 = 4s - 4 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{s^2}{4} = 4s - 4 \\]\n\\[ s^2 = 16s - 16 \\]\n\\[ s^2 - 16s + 16 = 0 \\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation.

      "model_output": "<think>\nTo find the area of the grey zone, we need to understand the geometric configuration of the three circles. Each circle has a radius of 2, and they intersect such that each point of intersection between two circles coincides with the center of the third circle.\n\nThis configuration forms an equilateral triangle with side length equal to the diameter of the circles, which is 4. The area of the equilateral triangle can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \\]\nwhere \\( s \\) is the side length of the triangle. Here, \\( s = 4 \\), so:\n\\[ A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 4^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 16 = 4\\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nThe area of the grey zone is the area of the equilateral triangle minus the area of the three circular segments that are outside the triangle but inside the circles. Since the circles intersect at their centers, the area of each segment is half the area of a circle with radius 2, because the segment is exactly half of a circle (since the angle subtended by the chord at the center is 120 degrees, which is half of 180 degrees).\n\nThe area of one circular segment is:\n\\[ \\text{Area of one segment} = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi r^2 - \\frac{1}{6} \\pi r^2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 \\]\nSince \\( r = 2 \\), the area of one segment is:\n\\[ \\text{Area of one segment} = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\times 2^2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\times 4 = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\]\n\nSince there are three such segments, the total area of the segments is:\n\\[ \\text{Total area of segments} = 3 \\times \\frac{4\\pi}{3} = 4\\pi \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation includes the area of the equilateral triangle twice, once for each of the three segments. Therefore, we need to subtract the area of the equilateral triangle from the total area of the segments:\n\\[ \\text{Area of the grey zone} = 4\\pi - 4\\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nBut since the problem asks for the area of the grey zone, and the correct interpretation should be the area of the equilateral triangle minus the area of the segments that are outside the triangle but inside the circles, we realize that the correct approach is to consider the area of the equilateral triangle minus the area of the segments that are inside the triangle but outside the circles, which simplifies to the area of the equilateral triangle itself.\n\nThus, the area of the grey zone is simply the area of the equilateral triangle:\n\\[ \\text{Area of the grey zone} = 4\\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nHowever, the problem seems to have a different interpretation where the area of the grey zone is actually the area of the equilateral triangle minus the area of the segments that are inside the triangle but outside the circles, which simplifies to the area of the equilateral triangle itself. But the correct interpretation based on the problem's context should be the area of the equilateral triangle minus the area of the segments that are inside the triangle but outside the circles, which simplifies to the area of the equilateral triangle itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n</think>\n<answer>\nD\n</answer>",

From the graph, we can see that the parabola opens upwards, indicating that \\( a > 0 \\).\n\n2. **Identify the Line's Equation:**\n   The line intersects the parabola at two points.

Since the line intersects the parabola at these points, the coordinates of these points satisfy both the parabola's equation and the line's equation.\n\n3. **Analyze the Intersection Points:**\n   - The line passes through the origin, so if the line is \\( y = mx \\), then \\( m = 0 \\) because the line must intersect the y-axis at the same point as the parabola.\n   - Therefore, the line equation simplifies to \\( y = mx \\).\n\n4. **Check the Options:**\n   - Option (A): \\( y = bx + c \\)\n     - This option suggests that the slope \\( b \\) is not zero, which contradicts our earlier conclusion that the line passes through the origin.\n   - Option (B): \\( y = cx + b \\)\n     - This option suggests that the slope \\( c \\) is not zero, which also contradicts our earlier conclusion.\n   - Option (C): \\( y = ax + b \\)\n     - This option suggests that the slope \\( a \\) is not zero, which again contradicts our earlier conclusion.\n   - Option (D): \\( y = ax + c \\)\n     - This option suggests that the slope \\( a \\) is not zero, which again contradicts our earlier conclusion.\n   - Option (E): \\( y = cx + a \\)\n     - This option suggests that the slope \\( c \\) is not zero, which again contradicts our earlier conclusion.\n\nSince none of the options directly match our conclusion that the line passes through the origin with a slope of zero, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

This means that each cut increases the surface area by twice the area of the cut face. Since there are six cuts, and each cut increases the surface area by twice the area of the cut face, the total increase in surface area due to the cuts is \\(6 \\times 2 \\times \\text{area of one cut face}\\).\n\nHowever, we need to be careful not to double-count the areas of the faces that are now exposed. Each cut exposes two new faces, but these faces were previously part of the original surface area. Therefore, the net increase in surface area is simply the area of the cut faces added once.\n\nSince there are six cuts, and each cut adds an area equal to the area of one face of the cuboid, the total increase in surface area is \\(6 \\times \\text{area of one face}\\). But since the original surface area \\(X\\) is already the sum of the areas of all the faces of the cuboid, the net increase in surface area is just the area of the cut faces added once, which is \\(6 \\times \\frac{X}{6} = X\\).\n\nThus, the total surface area of all 27 smaller solids is \\(X + X = 2X\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\(\\boxed{B}\\).\n</think>\n<answer>\nB\n</answer>",

The spiral starts at 1 and spirals outward, increasing the number counterclockwise.\n\nThe key observation is that each new layer of the spiral adds four numbers. This means that the total number of numbers in the \\(n\\)-th layer is \\(4(n-1)\\). We can use this to find out which layer the numbers 625, 626, and 627 fall into.\n\nFirst, let's find the layer for 625:\n\\[4(n-1) = 625 \\implies n-1 = \\frac{625}{4} = 156.25\\]\nSince \\(n\\) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number:\n\\[n = 157\\]\nSo, 625 is in the 157th layer.\n\nNext, let's find the layer for 626:\n\\[4(n-1) = 626 \\implies n-1 = \\frac{626}{4} = 156.5\\]\nRounding up, we get:\n\\[n = 157\\]\nSo, 626 is also in the 157th layer.\n\nFinally, let's find the layer for 627:\n\\[4(n-1) = 627 \\implies n-1 = \\frac{627}{4} = 156.75\\]\nRounding up, we get:\n\\[n = 157\\]\nSo, 627 is also in the 157th layer.\n\nNow, we need to determine the position of these numbers within the 157th layer. Since the 157th layer has 624 numbers (since \\(4(156) = 624\\)), the numbers 625, 626, and 627 are the last three numbers in the 157th layer.

So, the sequence could look like B-G-B-G-B-G-B-G-B.\n\n2. **Determine the number of boys**: Since there are seven children in total, and they are placed in a circle with no two boys next to each other, the only possible arrangement is B-G-B-G-B-G-B.

The key point here is that the number of squares is odd (9), and the movement rule allows only horizontal or vertical moves, not diagonal moves. This means that the starting position will affect the parity of the number of squares visited.\n\nIf you start at an even-numbered square, you will end up visiting an odd number of squares because each move changes the parity of the square's number. For example, if you start at square 1, after moving to square 2, you will have visited 2 squares (an even number).

This route involves the segments \\(CF\\), \\(FG\\), \\(GH\\), and \\(GC\\). Since \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are points on the same line segment \\(FG\\), we can express \\(CF\\) and \\(GC\\) in terms of the segments already known. Specifically, \\(CF = x + v\\) and \\(GC = y + t\\).\n\nThe total length of the route for bus 4 is:\n\\[CF + FG + GH + GC = (x + v) + u + t + (y + t) = x + y + u + v + 2t\\]\n\nFrom Equation 2, we know:\n\\[x + y + v + u + t = 12\\]\nSo,\n\\[x + y + u + v + 2t = 12 + t\\]\n\nSince \\(CD = z\\) and \\(DE = w\\), we can substitute \\(z\\) and \\(w\\) into the equation.

We can directly use the information from Equation 2 and the fact that the total length of the route for bus 4 is part of the total length of the route for bus 3 minus the segments not covered by bus 4.\n\nGiven that the total length of the route for bus 3 is 20 km and the route for bus 4 is part of the route for bus 3, we can deduce that the length of the route for bus 4 is:\n\\[20 - 12 = 8 \\text{ km}\\]\n\nTherefore, the length of the route followed by bus 4 is \\(\\boxed{B}\\).\n</think>\n<answer>B</answer>",

This means each path should have \\( \\frac{8}{3} \\approx 2.67 \\) trees, but since we can't have a fraction of a tree, we need to adjust the distribution slightly.\n\nLet's try to balance the trees as evenly as possible:\n\n- Path AB: We can place 1 tree on each side, so we need 1 tree in A and 1 tree in B.\n- Path BC: We can place 1 tree on each side, so we need 1 tree in B and 1 tree in C.\n- Path CD: We can place 1 tree on each side, so we need 1 tree in C and 1 tree in D.\n- Path DE: We can place 1 tree on each side, so we need 1 tree in D and 1 tree in E.\n- Path EA: We can place 1 tree on each side, so we need 1 tree in A and 1 tree in E.\n\nThis gives us:\n- A: 1 tree\n- B: 1 tree\n- C: 1 tree\n- D: 1 tree\n- E: 1 tree\n\nHowever, this doesn't work because we have 5 trees instead of 6.

This will make C have 1 tree, and the other regions will have 2 or 3 trees, which will balance out when we add the sixth tree.\n\nTherefore, the sixth tree should be planted in region C.\n\n</think>\n<answer>D</answer>",

The cube has 6 faces, each with an area of \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) square units. Therefore, the total surface area of the cube is:\n\\[6 \\times 9 = 54\\] square units.\n\nNext, let's calculate the surface area of the shape on the right. The shape on the right is formed by removing a smaller cube from the larger cube. The smaller cube has a side length of 1 unit, so its surface area is:\n\\[6 \\times (1 \\times 1) = 6\\] square units.\n\nThe surface area of the original cube is 54 square units, but when we remove the smaller cube, we lose the surface area of the smaller cube that was previously part of the larger cube. However, we also gain the surface area of the new exposed faces of the smaller cube. Since the smaller cube is completely inside the larger cube, the net change in surface area is just the surface area of the smaller cube, which is 6 square units.\n\nTherefore, the surface area of the shape on the right is:\n\\[54 - 6 = 48\\] square units.\n\nSince it takes 9 litres of paint to cover the surface of the cube on the left, we can use this information to find out how much paint is needed for the shape on the right. The ratio of the surface areas will give us the ratio of the amounts of paint needed:\n\\[\\frac{48}{54} = \\frac{8}{9}\\]\n\nThis means that the amount of paint needed for the shape on the right is \\(\\frac{8}{9}\\) of the amount needed for the cube on the left. Since the cube on the left requires 9 litres of paint, the amount of paint needed for the shape on the right is:\n\\[9 \\times \\frac{8}{9} = 8\\] litres.\n\nTherefore, the amount of paint needed to cover the surface of the shape on the right is 8 litres.\n</think>\n<answer>\nB\n</answer>",

For our line \\(y = \\frac{1}{2}x\\), we rewrite it as \\(-\\frac{1}{2}x + y = 0\\), so \\(A = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), \\(B = 1\\), and \\(C = 0\\).\n\nSubstitute \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(x_1 = 3\\), and \\(y_1 = 3\\):\n\\[ d = \\frac{\\left| -\\frac{1}{2}(3) + 1(3) + 0 \\right|}{\\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + 1^2}} \\]\n\\[ d = \\frac{\\left| -\\frac{3}{2} + 3 \\right|}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4} + 1}} \\]\n\\[ d = \\frac{\\left| \\frac{3}{2} \\right|}{\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{4}}} \\]\n\\[ d = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}} \\]\n\\[ d = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{5}} \\]\n\\[ d = \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{5} \\]\n\nNow, calculate the area:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{5} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{5} \\]\n\nThis result does not match any of the given options. Let's recheck the steps and calculations.\n\nUpon re-evaluation, the correct approach should be:\n- Base \\(AB = 2\\)\n- Height from \\(C\\) to \\(AB\\) is calculated correctly as \\(\\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\)\n\nThus, the area is:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{5} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{",
