To answer this, we need to identify the material of the small red sedan and compare it with the motorbikes.\n\n1. The small red sedan appears to have a matte finish, which suggests it is not metallic.\n2. The motorbikes in the image appear to be metallic, as they reflect light and have shiny surfaces.\n3. Since the small red sedan is matte and the motorbikes are shiny, they are not made of the same material.\n\nGiven this analysis, there are no brown motorbikes that are made of the same material as the small red sedan.\n</think>\n<answer>\n0\n</answer>",

There is one small green regular bus, but it does not appear metallic.
