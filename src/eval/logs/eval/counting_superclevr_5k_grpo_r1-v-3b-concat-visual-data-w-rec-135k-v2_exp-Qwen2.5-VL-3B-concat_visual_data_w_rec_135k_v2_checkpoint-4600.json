To determine how many of these objects are made of the same material, we need to consider their visual characteristics:\n1. The green sedan has a shiny, reflective surface typical of metal.\n2. The yellow bicycle also has a shiny, reflective surface, indicating it is likely made of metal or a metal-like material.\n3. The teal airplane has a similar shiny, reflective surface, suggesting it is also made of metal or a metal-like material.\n\nGiven that all three objects have a shiny, reflective surface, they appear to be made of the same material.\n</think>\n<answer>2</answer>",

I see several objects that could potentially be fighters: a green biplane, a red airplane, and a small green object. However, none of these objects have the typical characteristics of a fighter plane, such as wings, engines, or a cockpit. The green biplane might resemble a fighter due to its shape, but it's not a standard fighter design. The red airplane also doesn't fit the typical fighter profile. The small green object looks more like a motorcycle or a small vehicle rather than a fighter plane. Therefore, based on the given objects, there are no fighters.\n</think>\n<answer>\n0\n</answer>",
