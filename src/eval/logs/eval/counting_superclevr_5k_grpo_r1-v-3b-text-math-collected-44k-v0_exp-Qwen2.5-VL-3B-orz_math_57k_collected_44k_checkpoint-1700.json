The first car on the left is cyan.\n2. The second car on the left is purple.\n3. The third car on the left is brown.\n4. The fourth car on the left is small and brown.\n5. The fifth object is a blue jet.\n\nThe question asks for the number of jets left of the small car that is in front of the small car that is on the left side of the rubber car. This means we need to focus on the small brown car that is in front of the purple car.\n\nThe small brown car is the fourth car from the left, and it is in front of the purple car. Therefore, there is only one jet to the left of this small brown car.\n\nSo, the number of jets left of the small car that is in front of the small car that is on the left side of the rubber car is 1.\n</think>\n<answer>1</answer>",
