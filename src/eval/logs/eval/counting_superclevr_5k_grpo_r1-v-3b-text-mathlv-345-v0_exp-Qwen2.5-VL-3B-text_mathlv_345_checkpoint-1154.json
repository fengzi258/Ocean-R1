Bicycles in the scene:\n   - Red road bike\n   - Yellow tandem bicycle\n   - Blue road bike\n   - Red utility bicycle\n\n2. Large bicycles:\n   - Red road bike\n   - Yellow tandem bicycle\n   - Blue road bike\n\n3.

Therefore, there are no cars that have the same size as the large cyan bus.\n</think>\n<answer>\n0\n</answer>",

Determine the position of the large cyan tandem bike relative to the other objects:\n   - The large cyan tandem bike is described as being \"on the left side\" of the brown rubber thing.\n\n3. Confirm if the brown rubber thing is indeed on the left side of the red school bus:\n   - The brown rubber thing is described as being \"on the left side\" of the red school bus, which matches our understanding of its position.\n\n4. Count the number of large cyan tandem bikes:\n   - There is only one large cyan tandem bike mentioned in the description.\n\nTherefore, there is 1 large cyan tandem bike.\n</think>\n<answer>\n1\n</answer>",
