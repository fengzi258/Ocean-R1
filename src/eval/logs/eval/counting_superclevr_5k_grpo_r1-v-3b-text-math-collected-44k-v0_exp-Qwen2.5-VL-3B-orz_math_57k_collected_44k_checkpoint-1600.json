Compare their sizes to the brown metallic bus.\n\nThere is one green object that appears to be a bicycle. It is larger than the brown metallic bus, which suggests it might be a tandem bicycle or a double bicycle. However, without more specific information about its shape, I can't confirm if it's the same size as the bus.\n\nSince there is only one green object visible, and it doesn't appear to be the same size as the brown metallic bus, my conclusion is that there is 0 green matte bicycle the same size as the brown metallic bus.\n</think>\n<answer>0</answer>",
