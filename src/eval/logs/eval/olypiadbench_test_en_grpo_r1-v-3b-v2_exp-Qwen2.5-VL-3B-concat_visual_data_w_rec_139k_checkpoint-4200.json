      "question": "Turbo the snail sits on a point on a circle with circumference 1. Given an infinite sequence of positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, \\ldots$. Turbo successively crawls distances $c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, \\ldots$ around the circle, each time choosing to crawl either clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\nFor example, if the sequence $c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, \\ldots$ is $0.4,0.6,0.3, \\ldots$, then Turbo may start crawling as follows:\n\n\nDetermine the largest constant $C>0$ with the following property: for every sequence of positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, \\ldots$ with $c_{i}<C$ for all $i$, Turbo can (after studying the sequence) ensure that there is some point on the circle that it will never visit or crawl across.",
