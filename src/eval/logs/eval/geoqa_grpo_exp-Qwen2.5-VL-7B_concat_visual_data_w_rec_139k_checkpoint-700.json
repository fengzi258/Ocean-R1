This implies that triangle OCD is isosceles with OC = OD.\n\nSince angle CAD = 110°, we can use the fact that the sum of angles around point A is 360°. The angle at the center corresponding to arc CD is twice the angle at the circumference subtended by the same arc. Therefore, angle COD = 2 * angle CAD = 2 * 110° = 220° / 2 = 110°.\n\nIn an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. So, angle OCD = angle ODC = (180° - 110°) / 2 = 35°.\n\nSince angle B is subtended by the same arc as angle OCD, angle B = angle OCD = 35°.\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n35°\n</answer>",

The key insight here is that the shortest chord passing through a fixed point on a circle and tangent to another line is perpendicular to the radius drawn from the center of the circle to the point of tangency.\n\nSince the circle is tangent to AB at some point, the radius from the center of the circle to this point of tangency is perpendicular to AB.

The given lengths are AB = 4.0, BC = 5.0, and DE = 3.0.\n\nSince AB and BC form a right angle and are perpendicular to each other, they can be considered as the legs of a right triangle where the hypotenuse would be the diagonal of the rectangle. However, we need to focus on the circle and the segments it intersects.\n\nThe key here is that the circle is tangent to the sides of the rectangle at points B and C, and intersects the sides at E and F. Since the circle is tangent to the sides of the rectangle, the distances from the center of the circle to these tangents are equal to the radius of the circle.\n\nGiven that DE = 3.0, this segment is parallel to AB and BC, and since the circle is symmetrically placed, the segment EF will be equal to the segment DE because the circle's tangency properties ensure symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the length of EF is the same as DE, which is 3.0.\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n3.0\n</answer>",

We know that from point A, the direction to lighthouse C is 26° west of north, and from point B, the direction to lighthouse C is 52° west of north. This means that angle ABC is 52° - 26° = 26°.\n\nSince AB = 25.0 nautical miles and angle ABC = 26°, we can use the Law of Sines in triangle ABC to find BC. However, since we only have one side and one angle, we can directly use the fact that the angle at B is 26° and the distance AB is 25.0 nautical miles.\n\nThe distance BC can be found using the sine rule:\n\\[ \\frac{BC}{\\sin(26^\\circ)} = \\frac{AB}{\\sin(\\angle ACB)} \\]\nBut since we don't have angle ACB, we can use the direct relationship for the distance:\n\\[ BC = AB \\cdot \\frac{\\sin(52^\\circ)}{\\sin(26^\\circ)} \\]\n\nHowever, a simpler approach is to recognize that the problem setup implies that the distance BC is directly proportional to the distance AB and the angles involved. Given the symmetry and the specific angles provided, the distance BC is simply the same as the distance AB because the angles and the setup suggest a direct proportionality.\n\nThus, the distance from point B to lighthouse C is:\n\\[ BC = 25.0 \\text{ nautical miles} \\]\n\n</think>\n<answer>\n25.0\n</answer>",

At point A, the lighthouse M is 60 degrees east of north. At point B, the lighthouse M is 15 degrees east of north. This means that the angle ∠AMB is 60 - 15 = 45 degrees.\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Cosines in triangle AMB to find the distance MB.

The sum of the interior angles around point O (where diagonals intersect) is 360°. However, since we are only interested in ∠COD, we can use the fact that it is supplementary to the adjacent angles ∠OBC and ∠OCD.\n\nThe key here is recognizing that ∠COD is the sum of the angles ∠OBC and ∠OCD minus 180° because they form a straight line with ∠COD.\n\nSince ∠OBC = ∠DBC = 42° and ∠OCD = ∠DAC = 42°, we can calculate ∠COD as follows:\n\n∠COD = 180° - (∠OBC + ∠OCD)\n∠COD = 180° - (42° + 42°)\n∠COD = 180° - 84°\n∠COD = 96°\n\nHowever, this approach seems to be incorrect based on the given options. Let's re-evaluate using simpler geometric properties.\n\nSince ∠COD is the angle between the diagonals of a parallelogram, and knowing that the diagonals bisect each other, we can directly use the given angles to find ∠COD.\n\n∠COD = 180° - (∠OBC + ∠OCD)\n∠COD = 180° - (42° + 23°)\n∠COD = 180° - 65°\n∠COD = 115°\n\nBut this also seems incorrect. Let's consider the simpler property that ∠COD is simply the sum of the angles ∠OBC and ∠OCD minus 180°, but since they are supplementary, we can directly use the given angles.\n\n∠COD = 180° - (42° + 23°)\n∠COD = 180° - 65°\n∠COD = 115°\n\nThis seems to be the correct approach. Therefore, the correct answer is 115°.\n</think>\n\n<answer>115°</answer>",
