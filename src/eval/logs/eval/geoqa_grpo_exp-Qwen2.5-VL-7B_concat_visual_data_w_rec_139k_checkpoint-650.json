The distance between the bases of the two street lamps is 30 meters, and Xiaogang walked 25 meters from the base of street lamp A to the base of street lamp B.\n\nWhen Xiaogang is at the base of street lamp A, the angle of elevation from his eyes to the top of street lamp A is the same as the angle of elevation from his eyes to the top of street lamp B after he has walked 25 meters. This means that the triangles formed by the street lamps and Xiaogang's position are similar.\n\nThe ratio of the heights of the street lamps to the distances from Xiaogang's position to the bases of the street lamps will be equal. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{h_A}{x} = \\frac{h_B}{x + 25}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( x \\) is the distance from Xiaogang's initial position to the base of street lamp A.

Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\nh_A - 1.5 = \\frac{h_B}{3} - 1.5\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n\\[\nh_A = \\frac{h_B}{3} + 1.5\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( h_A = \\frac{h_B}{3} \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{h_B}{3} = \\frac{h_B}{3} + 1.5\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nh_B = 4.5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the height of the street lamp A is:\n\n\\[\nh_A = \\frac{4.5}{3} = 1.5\n\\]\n\nSo, the height of the street lamp is:\n\n\\[\nh_A + 1.5 = 4.5\n\\]\n\nThus, the height of the street lamp is \\( 4.5 \\) meters.\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n4.5\n</answer>",

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, we can calculate it as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{angle BAC} = 180^\\circ - \\text{angle ABC} - \\text{angle C} = 180^\\circ - 35^\\circ - 50^\\circ = 95^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNext, since BD is the angle bisector of angle ABC, it divides angle ABC into two equal angles each measuring:\n\n\\[\n\\text{angle ABD} = \\text{angle DBC} = \\frac{\\text{angle ABC}}{2} = \\frac{35^\\circ}{2} = 17.5^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNow, consider triangle ABD. Since AE is perpendicular to BD, angle AEB is 90 degrees. Therefore, angle BAD can be found by subtracting angle ABD from 90 degrees:\n\n\\[\n\\text{angle BAD} = 90^\\circ - \\text{angle ABD} = 90^\\circ - 17.5^\\circ = 72.5^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSince angle BAC is 95 degrees, angle DAC is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{angle DAC} = \\text{angle BAC} - \\text{angle BAD} = 95^\\circ - 72.5^\\circ = 22.5^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the measure of angle CDE. Notice that angle CDE is part of triangle CDE. To find angle CDE, we need to use the fact that the sum of the angles in triangle CDE is 180 degrees. We already know angle C is 50 degrees and angle DCE is half of angle ABC because BD is the angle bisector:\n\n\\[\n\\text{angle DCE} = \\text{angle DBC} = 17.5^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThus, angle CDE is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{angle CDE} = 180^\\circ - \\text{angle C} - \\text{angle DCE} = 180^\\circ - 50^\\circ - 17.5^\\circ = 112.5^\\circ\n\\]\n\nHowever, this calculation seems incorrect because angle CDE should be smaller. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the correct geometric properties.\n\nSince angle CDE is part of triangle CDE and we have the correct angle measures, we can directly state:\n\n\\[\n\\text{angle CDE} = 180^\\circ - 95^\\circ - 35^\\circ = 50^\\circ\n\\]\n\nBut the correct approach is to use the fact that angle CDE is the external angle to angle DCE in triangle CDE:\n\n\\[\n\\text{angle CDE} = 180^\\circ - 95^\\circ - 35^\\circ = 50^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThe correct angle is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{17.5}\n\\]\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n17.5\n</answer>",

The key observation here is that the umbrella is symmetric about the handle \\(AP\\), and when it is opened, the points \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) lie on the same straight line with \\(D\\) being the midpoint of \\(BC\\).\n\nFirst, let's denote the length of \\(BC\\) as \\(x\\).

The center of the circle, say \\(O\\), lies on the angle bisector of \\(\\angle BAC\\) because the circle is tangent to \\(AB\\) and passes through \\(C\\).\n\nThe minimum length of \\(EF\\) occurs when the circle is as small as possible while still satisfying the conditions. This happens when the circle is tangent to \\(AB\\) at its closest point to \\(C\\), which is when the radius is minimized but still tangent to \\(AB\\).\n\nUsing the properties of the triangle and the circle, we can use the fact that the minimum distance from the center of the circle to the sides of the triangle (in this case, \\(AB\\)) is the radius of the circle. The radius of the circle is the same as the altitude from \\(C\\) to \\(AB\\) divided by 2 (since the circle is tangent to \\(AB\\) and passes through \\(C\\)).\n\nThe area of triangle \\(ABC\\) can be calculated using Heron's formula or by finding the altitude from \\(C\\) to \\(AB\\).

The key insight is to use the concept of reflection.\n\nFirst, reflect points \\(O\\) and \\(D\\) across lines \\(OA\\) and \\(OB\\) respectively. Let's denote the reflections as follows:\n- Reflect \\(O\\) across \\(OA\\) to get \\(O'\\).\n- Reflect \\(D\\) across \\(OB\\) to get \\(D'\\).\n\nSince \\(OA\\) is the perpendicular bisector of \\(MC\\), \\(O'\\) will be directly above or below \\(C\\) at the same distance from \\(OA\\). Similarly, since \\(OB\\) is the perpendicular bisector of \\(MD\\), \\(D'\\) will be directly to the left or right of \\(M\\) at the same distance from \\(OB\\).\n\nThe shortest path for the ant is equivalent to the straight-line distance from \\(M\\) to \\(O'\\) to \\(D'\\) to \\(M\\). This is because reflecting the points allows us to \"unfold\" the plane such that the path becomes a straight line.\n\nNow, let's calculate the coordinates of these reflected points:\n- Since \\(O\\) is the midpoint of \\(MC\\), \\(O'\\) will be directly above \\(C\\) at the same distance from \\(OA\\). Therefore, \\(O'\\) is at \\((0, 7)\\).\n- Since \\(D\\) is the midpoint of \\(MD\\), \\(D'\\) will be directly to the left of \\(M\\) at the same distance from \\(OB\\). Therefore, \\(D'\\) is at \\((-5, 0)\\).\n\nThe distance from \\(M\\) to \\(O'\\) is the same as the distance from \\(M\\) to \\(C\\), which is 7 units.\nThe distance from \\(O'\\) to \\(D'\\) is the Euclidean distance between \\((0, 7)\\) and \\((-5, 0)\\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(0 - (-5))^2 + (7 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{5^2 + 7^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 49} = \\sqrt{74}\n\\]\nThe distance from \\(D'\\) to \\(M\\) is the same as the distance from \\(D\\) to \\(M\\), which is 5 units.\n\nTherefore, the total shortest path is:\n\\[\n7 + \\sqrt{74} + 5 = 12 + \\sqrt{74}\n\\]\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the shortest path, and the correct interpretation is the straight-line distance from \\(M\\) to \\(O'\\) to \\(D'\\) to \\(M\\), which simplifies to the sum of the distances from \\(M\\) to \\(O'\\) and from \\(O'\\) to \\(D'\\) and from \\(D'\\) to \\(M\\).\n\nThus, the shortest path the ant can take is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]</think>\n<answer>\n12</answer>",

Since the circle is tangent to \\(AB\\) and passes through \\(C\\), the center of the circle must lie on the angle bisector of \\(\\angle ACB\\). This is because the radius to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line, and the center of the circle is equidistant from all points on the circumference.\n\nThe minimum length of the chord \\(PQ\\) will occur when the circle is such that the chord \\(PQ\\) is parallel to \\(AB\\) and is the shortest possible distance from \\(C\\) to the line \\(AB\\).
