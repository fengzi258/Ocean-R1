Let's assume that the three circled figures are identical triangles or rectangles. For simplicity, let's assume they are all right triangles with legs of equal length. If we consider the largest triangle as having legs of 6.0 units each, then its area would be:\n\\[ \\text{Area of one triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6.0 \\times 6.0 = 18.0 \\]\nSince there are three such triangles, the total area of the three triangles is:\n\\[ \\text{Total Area of three triangles} = 3 \\times 18.0 = 54.0 \\]\n\nNow, we need to subtract the area of the square that is not part of the three triangles from the total area of the square.

Angle BAD is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AD. According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. Therefore, the measure of angle BAD is:\n\\[ \\text{Measure of angle BAD} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Measure of arc AD} \\]\n\nTo find the measure of arc AD, we subtract the measure of arc BD from the full circle (360°):\n\\[ \\text{Measure of arc AD} = 360^\\circ - 100^\\circ = 260^\\circ \\]\n\nThus, the measure of angle BAD is:\n\\[ \\text{Measure of angle BAD} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 260^\\circ = 130^\\circ \\]\n\nTherefore, the measure of angle BAD is 130°.\n</think>\n<answer>\n130\n</answer>",

Therefore, \\(\\angle AOB = 2 \\times 30^\\circ = 60^\\circ\\).\n\nNow, consider triangle \\(ABP\\). Since \\(PB = AB\\), triangle \\(ABP\\) is isosceles with \\(PB = AB\\). The angle \\(\\angle BAP\\) is equal to \\(\\angle ABP\\) because \\(AB = PB\\). Let \\(\\angle BAP = \\angle ABP = x\\). Then, \\(\\angle APB = 180^\\circ - 2x\\).\n\nSince \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are points on the circle, \\(\\angle AOB = 60^\\circ\\). The arc \\(AB\\) subtends this angle at the center, so the central angle \\(\\angle AOB = 60^\\circ\\) implies that the inscribed angle \\(\\angle ACB = 30^\\circ\\) subtends the same arc \\(AB\\). This means that \\(\\angle APB = 180^\\circ - 2x = 120^\\circ\\) because \\(\\angle APB\\) is the external angle to the isosceles triangle \\(ABP\\) and it is supplementary to the base angles \\(x\\).\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Cosines in triangle \\(ABP\\):\n\\[PA^2 = AB^2 + PB^2 - 2 \\cdot AB \\cdot PB \\cdot \\cos(120^\\circ)\\]\nSince \\(AB = PB\\), let \\(AB = PB = r\\). Then,\n\\[PA^2 = r^2 + r^2 - 2 \\cdot r \\cdot r \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 2r^2 + r^2 = 3r^2\\]\nThus,\n\\[PA = r\\sqrt{3} = 5\\sqrt{3}\\]\n\nTherefore, the length of \\(PA\\) is \\(5\\sqrt{3}\\).\n</think>\n<answer>\n5\\sqrt{3}\n</answer>",

The chord AB is tangent to the small circle at some point.\n\nFirst, we need to find the relationship between the chord length AB and the radii \\( r \\) and \\( R \\).

Angle BCD is an inscribed angle that subtends the same arc BC as the central angle BOD. Therefore, the measure of angle BCD is half the measure of arc BC:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Measure of angle BCD} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Measure of arc BC} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 55^\\circ = 27.5^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThus, the measure of angle BCD is 27.5 degrees.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\n27.5\n</answer>",

Using the cosine of \\(30^\\circ\\):\n     \\[\n     b = AC \\cos(60^\\circ) = 4.0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 2.0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     c = AC \\cos(60^\\circ) = 4.0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 2.0\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, \\(B = (2.0, 0)\\) and \\(C = (2.0, 0)\\).\n\n3. **Symmetry Points \\(E\\) and \\(F\\):**\n   - Point \\(D\\) is a moving point on the x-axis, so let \\(D = (x, 0)\\).\n   - The symmetrical point \\(E\\) of \\(D\\) with respect to the line \\(AB\\) is found by reflecting \\(D\\) over \\(AB\\).\n   - The equation of line \\(AB\\) is \\(y = \\sqrt{3}(x - 2.0)\\) (since it passes through \\(A = (0, a)\\) and \\(B = (2.0, 0)\\)).\n   - Reflecting \\(D = (x, 0)\\) over \\(AB\\) gives \\(E = (x', y')\\).\n\n4. **Calculate \\(E\\):**\n   - The reflection formula for a point \\((x, y)\\) over a line \\(Ax + By + C = 0\\) is:\n     \\[\n     x' = \\frac{(B^2 - A^2)x + 2ABy + 2AC}{A^2 + B^2}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y' = \\frac{(A^2 - B^2)y + 2BCx + 2AC}{A^2 + B^2}\n     \\]\n   - For \\(AB\\), \\(A = \\sqrt{3}\\), \\(B = -1\\), and \\(C = 0\\). Substituting these values:\n     \\[\n     x' = \\frac{(-1)^2 x + 2\\sqrt{3} \\cdot 0 \\cdot x + 2\\sqrt{3} \\cdot 0}{(\\sqrt{3})^2 + (-1)^2} = \\frac{x}{4}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y' = \\frac{(\\sqrt{3})^2 \\cdot 0 + 2 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 0 \\cdot x + 2 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 0}{(\\sqrt{3})^2 + (-1)^2} = \\frac{-2\\sqrt{3}x}{4} = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}x\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, \\(E = \\left(\\frac{x}{4}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}x\\right)\\).\n\n5. **Calculate \\(F\\):**\n   - Similarly, the symmetrical point \\(F\\) of \\(D\\) with respect to the line \\(AC\\) is found by reflecting \\(D\\) over \\(AC\\).\n   - The equation of line \\(AC\\) is \\(y = -\\sqrt{3}(x - 0) = -\\sqrt{3}x\\) (since it passes through \\(A = (0, a)\\) and \\(C = (2.0, 0)\\)).\n   - Reflecting \\(D = (x, 0)\\) over \\(AC\\) gives \\(F = (x'', y'')\\).\n\n6. **Calculate \\(F\\):**\n   - Using the same reflection formula:\n",

Since opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal, BC = AD = 15.0 and CD = AB = 10.0.\n\nNow, let's consider triangle ABE. Since OE is perpendicular to BD, OE is the height from A to BD.

Also, since OE is perpendicular to BD, triangle AOE is a right triangle with OE as one of its legs.

Since MN is parallel to BC and forms a smaller similar triangle with BC, the ratio of the sides is the same as the ratio of the heights from A to BD and CE to BC.\n\nIf we assume the height from A to BD is h1 and the height from A to CE is h2, then the ratio of MN to BC is the same as the ratio of h1 to h1 + h2.

Now, angle COD is an exterior angle to triangle BCD, which means it is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.\n   Therefore, angle COD = angle DAC + angle CBD = 42.0° + 23.0° = 65.0°.\n\nHence, the measure of angle COD is 65.0°.\n</think>\n<answer>\n65.0°\n</answer>",

We need to find the measure of angle 2 when angle 1 is given as 30.0 degrees.\n\nFirst, let's understand the relationship between the angles formed by the right triangle and the ruler. The right triangle has a right angle (90 degrees), and the sum of all angles around point O (where the right angle vertex is placed) is 360 degrees. Since the ruler is straight, it forms a straight line (180 degrees) with the right angle.\n\nGiven that angle 1 is 30.0 degrees, we can determine the other angle adjacent to it on the ruler. Since the sum of angles around point O is 360 degrees, and the right angle is 90 degrees, the remaining two angles must sum up to 270 degrees (360 - 90). If angle 1 is 30.0 degrees, then the adjacent angle on the ruler would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Adjacent angle} = 180^\\circ - 30^\\circ = 150^\\circ \\]\n\nNow, since angle 2 is part of the same straight line with the right angle, it will be supplementary to the adjacent angle on the ruler.
